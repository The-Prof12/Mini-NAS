## Housing 
The housing is made to look like Borg Cube. Opion one is perfered but the but likly due to rf inference some variation of option two will be needed.

Two possible routes

1. 3d printing a steel cube split in two on the top and pcb staked up and lowered into to the larger half. Finish would likely be powder coated.
2. Frame is 3d printed out of metal with and resin printed side pannels.
